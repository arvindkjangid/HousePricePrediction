## General Information
- Project is regarding house price prediction.
- Project is type of predictive analytics using Linear Regression.
- To create a machine learning model to predict house prediction on unseen data.
- Housing data.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Did lots of EDA and identify the relationship between independent and target variable.
- Perform simple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression & Lasso Regression.
- Outcome of Ridge regression is good in term of R-square values, for cofficients understandability outcome of Lasso is better,
